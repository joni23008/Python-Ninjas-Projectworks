Powerpoint tai video.

Part 1)
Find some other interesting dataset than the Iris dataset from Kaggle on which you can perform k-means classification
- penguins
Run k-means algorithm on that data. You should use the k-means sklearn version.
- juujuu
List 2 interesting use cases for applying k-means algorithm for real world.
These may or may not be business cases.
- en vittu tiieä



Part 2)
Make experiments on your algorithm with different values of k
- tää pitäis tehä ehk jollai loopil jos jaksaa
Utilize the Elbow method
- check
Consider what is the effect of different training/testing split portions on your data now (like 80/20 training/testing split we used earlier)
Hint/Edit: Hmmm!! Think how is the situation now different from supervised learning (kNN) case
- tänki vois yrittää väsää viel
Test the effect of various options of the k-means algorithm. (See the sklean documentation for k-means)
- jotai tästkin
Decide which experiments you show on submit PowerPoint (or video). No need to show everything by everyone.
- ok
