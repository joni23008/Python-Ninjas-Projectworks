Part 1  (Familiaring and basic testing of kNN algorithm)
Find some other interesting dataset than the Iris dataset from Kaggle on which you can perform kNN classification
Run kNN algorithm on that data
Use the sklearn version
List 2 interesting use cases for applying kNN algorithm for real world
These may or may not be business cases

Part 2 (Experimenting with the kNN algorithm more in detail)
Make experiments on your algorithms with different values of k
Study the effect of different training/testing split portions on your data (like 80/20 training/testing split)
Try k-Fold approach
